# <span style="color:blue;">**Real Estate Data Classification Project**</span>

Welcome to our project for **_AAI-501 Intro to Artificial Intelligence_**, a collaborative effort by Team 4: **Laxmi, Daniel, & Thai**. We aim to explore various classification algorithms to analyze a Real Estate dataset with Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## <span style="color:green;">**Project Overview**</span>

Real estate pricing is influenced by a multitude of factors, including location, property characteristics, economic conditions, and market trends. Our project aims to address the complexity of this domain by developing a classification model that can accurately categorize housing listings into distinct pricing tiers. Such a model will facilitate more informed decision-making for both buyers and sellers, helping them navigate the market with greater insight.

To achieve our goal, we utilize Python and Jupyter Notebooks as our primary tools for processing, analyzing, and modeling real estate data. This technical framework allows us to efficiently explore a variety of classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Deep Learning Neural Networks, and Gradient Boosting. Our approach is designed to leverage the strengths of these algorithms to predict pricing tiers based on an array of property features, thus tackling the multifaceted challenge of real estate pricing with precision and nuance.

This consolidated overview succinctly captures the essence of your project, outlining both the problem space and the methodological approach your team is taking.

## **Problem Statement**

**Pricing Tier Classification:** Create a classification model to categorize housing listings into pricing tiers based on features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, lot size, living space size, and location. The goal is to classify properties into different price ranges, enabling buyers and sellers to identify suitable options within their budget constraints and market expectations. 


## **System Intention**

The project involves:
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Defining pricing tiers
- Encoding categorical values
- Feature selection and dataset splitting
- Model selection, training, and evaluation
- Integration, deployment, and monitoring of models

### **Focus Areas**

- **Data Quality and Preparation**: Handling missing values, outliers, and imbalanced classes.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying and engineering relevant features.
- **Model Complexity**: Balancing complexity with performance to avoid overfitting.
- **Computational Resources**: Ensuring efficient training and evaluation.
- **Ethical and Fairness Considerations**: Ensuring the model's fairness and transparency.

## **Expected Behaviors and Problem Handling**

We aim to provide a reliable classification of real estate into pricing tiers using advanced algorithms like decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, ensuring accuracy through rigorous data preprocessing and model evaluation.
