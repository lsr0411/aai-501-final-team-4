# AAI-501 Final Project: Real Estate Data Classification

Welcome to our AAI-501 Intro to Artificial Intelligence project. We're delving into the complexities of real estate pricing, aiming to make this intricate market more accessible to buyers, sellers, and enthusiasts alike. Our journey uses Python and Jupyter Notebooks to sift through a Real Estate dataset, exploring various classification algorithms to predict pricing tiers accurately.

## <span style="color:green;">**Project Overview**</span>

The real estate market is a tapestry woven from various factors â€” location, property features, economic conditions, and more. Our mission? To unravel this complexity by creating a model that classifies properties into distinct pricing tiers. This tool is designed to empower decision-making, offering insights that pave the way for a deeper market understanding.

Utilizing Python and Jupyter Notebooks allows us to efficiently process and model data, exploring algorithms from Logistic Regression to Gradient Boosting. Our goal is to illuminate patterns within the real estate realm, making the market's intricacies navigable for all.

## **Classification Criteria**

In 2024's diverse market landscape, we've outlined four pricing tiers to guide our classification:

* Budget: Up to $250,000 - Ideal for first-time buyers or renovators.
* Mid-Range: $250,001 to $500,000 - Modern homes in sought-after areas.
* High-End: $500,001 to $1,000,000 - Luxurious properties with top-tier amenities.
* Luxury: Over $1,000,000 - Exclusive estates with unparalleled quality.

These tiers, shaped by market dynamics and detailed analysis, form the backbone of our model, ensuring relevance and adaptability in our market predictions.

## Technologies Used

This project is implemented using the following technologies:
* Python: Our cornerstone for data manipulation and analysis.
* Jupyter Notebook: For interactive modeling and visualization.
* Classification Algorithms: Including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and more, to finely tune our predictions.

## **Problem Statement**

**Pricing Tier Classification:** Create a classification model to categorize housing listings into pricing tiers based on features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, lot size, living space size, and location. The goal is to classify properties into different price ranges, enabling buyers and sellers to identify suitable options within their budget constraints and market expectations. 

## **System Intention**

The project involves:
- Data cleaning and preparation
- Defining pricing tiers
- Encoding categorical values
- Feature selection and dataset splitting
- Model selection, training, and evaluation
- Integration, deployment, and monitoring of models

### **Focus Areas**

- **Data Quality and Preparation**: Handling missing values, outliers, and imbalanced classes.
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying and engineering relevant features.
- **Model Complexity**: Balancing complexity with performance to avoid overfitting.
- **Computational Resources**: Ensuring efficient training and evaluation.
- **Ethical and Fairness Considerations**: Ensuring the model's fairness and transparency.

## **Expected Behaviors and Problem Handling**

We aim to provide a reliable classification of real estate into pricing tiers using advanced algorithms like decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, ensuring accuracy through rigorous data preprocessing and model evaluation.
